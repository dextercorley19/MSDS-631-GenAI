1. **Prepare the Dataset**  
Download a dataset with image-caption pairs, such as the [Conceptual Captions](https://github.com/google-research-datasets/conceptual-captions) dataset from TensorFlow Datasets or a subset from the COCO dataset. Extract the dataset and note the path to the images and captions.

2. **Create a Jupyter Notebook**  
Create a new Jupyter notebook in the root directory of the cloned repository or alongside the helper notebook.

3. **Document Your Workflow**  
In your Jupyter notebook, document your entire workflow:
- **Introduction**: Briefly explain the goal of the assignment and the concept of CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training).
- **Data Preparation**: Show how you downloaded and prepared the image-caption dataset.
- **Training or Utilization**: Include the code to either train a CLIP model (using the repositoryâ€™s scripts) or utilize a pre-trained model. You may adapt the training loop from [train.py](https://github.com/openai/CLIP/blob/main/train.py) or use the helper notebook as a starting point.
- **Results Analysis**: Visualize the text-image alignment (e.g., cosine similarity scores), generate sample images using the model, and plot training curves if applicable. Discuss your findings.
- **Experimentation**: Experiment with different hyperparameters (e.g., learning rate, batch size) or dataset subsets and analyze their impact on performance.
After training or utilizing the model, analyze the results:
- Visualize text-image similarity scores and sample outputs.
- Evaluate performance using metrics like accuracy on a validation set or qualitative assessment of generated alignments.
- Experiment with different configurations to observe their effects on text-image alignment.

4. **Conclusion**  
Summarize your findings and insights gained from the experiment. Include any challenges you faced and how you overcame them.

5. **Submission**  
Submit the Jupyter notebook (.ipynb file) that contains all the above sections.

## Notes
- Ensure you follow best practices for coding and experimentation.
- Your notebook should be well-documented and easy to follow.
- Include visualizations and analyses that clearly demonstrate your understanding of CLIP and its application to text-image alignment.
